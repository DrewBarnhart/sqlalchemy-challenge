# sqlalchemy-challenge

This project ncorporates SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database. Specifically it utilizes SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplot lib. 

The code generated s based off two files: Climate_starter.ipynb ad hawaii.sqlit


Here is the listed procedure within the jupyter notebook: 
1. Use the SQLAlchemy create_engine() function to connect to your SQLite database.

2. Use the SQLAlchemy automap_base() function to reflect your tables into classes, and then save references to the classes named station and measurement.

3. Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.
